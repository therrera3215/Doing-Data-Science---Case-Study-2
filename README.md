# Introduction
Finding and losing good talent are both difficult endeavors. Talent management is one of DDS Analytics' specialties. We are always seeking ways to improve DDS analytics, which sets us apart from the rest. In an effort to better understand employee retention, we have recently embraced data science. Using existing company data, we have investigated the reasons for attrition. We want to identify why employees leave DDSAnalytics and then provide solutions on how to manage talent based on the results.

# Objectives:

Determine why employees leave DDSAnalytics
Identify the top three factors that contribute to turnover 
Identify job role specific trends that may exist in the data set 
Provide any other interesting trends and observations from your analysis
Build a model to predict attrition
KNN model
60 % specificity and 60 % sensitivity requirement 
Build a model to predict monthly income 
Linear regression model
RMSE < 3000 requirement 


# Summary:
Taking a look at the monthly income and job roles we found some interesting trends
Our study found that job level, overtime, and business travel contributed the most to employee turnover. An attrition model based on Naive Bayes was  built with a sensitivity of 91%, specificity of 86.27%, and accuracy of 87%. In order to predict monthly income, we built a linear regression model and came up with an RMSE of approximately 1297.
